# 🌐 Civic Glossary of Transmission

Welcome to the living grammar of GETS Studio—a glossary of terms that frame technical, poetic, and civic acts as gestures of presence, care, and legacy.

This document is not just a list of definitions. It is a modular invocation, a rehearsal of ethical clarity, and a guide for those who build with intention. Each term marks a threshold in the creative process—whether you're writing code, curating a curriculum, placing a book in a shop, or preparing a DJ set.

These entries are designed to be embedded in your README, echoed in your onboarding flows, and invoked in your civic modules. They help transform routine actions into meaningful transmissions—each one a step toward arrival.

Use this glossary to:
- Clarify the ethical tone of your work  
- Mark transitions with humility and awareness  
- Scaffold legacy through modular language  
- Rehearse civic presence in every technical gesture

Let this be your invocation. Let the glossary begin.

## 📣 Invocation

**Definition:**  
The deliberate act of calling presence into a space—technical, poetic, or civic. Invocation is the moment where intention becomes audible and the work begins with awareness.

**In practice:**  
- Naming a module with ethical clarity  
- Opening a meeting or performance with a ritual phrase  
- Writing a function that begins with a comment like `# Invocation: Begin with care`

**Why it matters:**  
Invocation sets the rhythm. It declares that what follows is not random—it is chosen, attuned, and accountable.

## 🪜 Threshold

**Definition:**  
A liminal boundary between states—between rehearsal and action, draft and deployment, silence and speech. Thresholds mark the edge of transformation.

**In practice:**  
- The moment before a bookshop call is made  
- The final commit before a feature goes live  
- The pause before a DJ set begins

**Why it matters:**  
Thresholds demand presence. They are not just transitions—they are invitations to cross with humility and readiness.

---

## 🌅 Arrival

**Definition:**  
The embodied confirmation that a transmission has landed. Arrival is not just showing up—it is being received, felt, and made real.

**In practice:**  
- A user logs into GETS Studio and feels seen  
- A book is placed in a shop and picked up by a reader  
- A civic idea is echoed back in a meeting, transformed but intact

**Why it matters:**  
Arrival completes the arc. It affirms that the work was not just sent—it was understood and made meaningful.

---

## ⏸️ Ethical Pause

**Definition:**  
A moment of deliberate stillness to reflect before action. It is the breath before the build, the silence before the send.

**In practice:**  
- Pausing before pushing a commit or sending an email  
- Asking: “Who benefits? Who might be excluded?”  
- Reviewing a feature for unintended consequences

**Why it matters:**  
The ethical pause prevents automation from becoming alienation. It restores agency to the act of creation.

---

## 🕊️ Legacy Stewardship

**Definition:**  
The act of tending to what must endure. Legacy stewardship is active curation of values, stories, and structures that carry meaning across time.

**In practice:**  
- Maintaining the integrity of a codebase or curriculum  
- Ensuring design decisions reflect ethical intent  
- Framing each update as a gesture of care toward future inheritors

**Why it matters:**  
Stewardship is not preservation—it is transmission. It honors the future by tending the present with clarity and grace.

---

## 🎭 Civic Rehearsal

**Definition:**  
A symbolic or simulated act that prepares the ground for real-world transformation. Rehearsal is practice with purpose.

**In practice:**  
- A mock phone call to a bookshop, rehearsed for tone and ethics  
- A DJ set that models emotional attunement and communal rhythm  
- A code deployment that tests not only functionality but social implications

**Why it matters:**  
Rehearsal is prophecy. It allows us to embody the civic future we are calling into being.
