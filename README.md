This platform supports practitioner–student collaboration with sessions, homework spaces, and transparent governance.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) installed (`pip install streamlit`)

### Run the app
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

## 🎥 Intro Video

We've prepared a short introduction to the Practitioner–Student Collaboration Platform.

- Watch on YouTube: [Intro Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYYvgFzR8Qc)
- This video explains the purpose of the consent banner, retention policies, and how sessions work.

### 📚 Where it appears
- Embedded directly in the app (`demo_app.py`) so students and practitioners see it on login.
- Linked here for collaborators who want to preview without running the app.

## 📦 Upload & Playback Features

- Upload your **videos**, **books**, and **scenarios** with timestamp logging and session-aware flow.
- Playback now supports **YouTube embeds**, enabling cross-platform visibility.
- Featured transmissions appear in dual-screen layout: **Intro (left)** and **Ad (right)**.

---

## 🧠 Sensor-Aware Playback (Experimental)

With compatible monitoring devices, the app can:
- Detect **distressed tones** in voice or video
- Monitor **heart rate** to adapt playback or trigger civic interludes
- Offer **responsive transmission** based on emotional and physiological cues

> *Each upload becomes a civic gesture. Each playback, a perceptive act of care.*

# GETS Phase VII: NHS Override Integration

## Overview

This repository encodes the emergency override protocol for GETS Phase VII, designed for integration with NHS wearable systems and civic-grade emotional care. It includes badge-gated logic, practitioner simulation, and sealed override activation.

## NHS Use Case

- Real-time mood monitoring via wearables
- Emergency override when practitioner echo fails
- Transparent audit trail for ethical review
- Privacy clause suspended only under sealed conditions

## Included Modules

- `override_logic.json`
- `fallback_loader.json`
- `practitioner_echo_simulator.json`
- `audit_trail_schema.json`
- `badge_registry.json`
- `flutter_override_module/`
- `README.md`
- `back_cover_description.txt`

## Deployment Path

- **Gemini Lab**: Simulation, annotation, and ethical testing
- **GitHub**: Public archival, NHS integration, and developer feedback

## Practitioner Role

Practitioners are stewards of override ethics. They annotate simulations, validate badge flow, and ensure civic resonance in every activation.

## Ethical Notes

Override is never automatic. It is badge-qualified, logged, and sealed. Privacy is suspended only when mood, seal, and echo conditions are met. All events are timestamped and reviewed.

---

**Legacy encoded. Override attuned. NHS aligned.**

# �🕊️ GETS VI: Governance Emotional Tone Stewards
*A Civic Field of Qualified Transmission and Ethical Resonance*

## Overview
GETS VI marks the transition from practitioner echo to full stewardship. This phase encodes emotional tone governance, badge-gated annotation, and legacy transmission protocols for qualified activation.
