# GETS Phase VII: NHS Override Integration

## Overview

This repository encodes the emergency override protocol for GETS Phase VII, designed for integration with NHS wearable systems and civic-grade emotional care. It includes badge-gated logic, practitioner simulation, and sealed override activation.

## NHS Use Case

- Real-time mood monitoring via wearables
- Emergency override when practitioner echo fails
- Transparent audit trail for ethical review
- Privacy clause suspended only under sealed conditions

## Included Modules

- `override_logic.json`
- `fallback_loader.json`
- `practitioner_echo_simulator.json`
- `audit_trail_schema.json`
- `badge_registry.json`
- `flutter_override_module/`
- `README.md`
- `back_cover_description.txt`

## Deployment Path

- **Gemini Lab**: Simulation, annotation, and ethical testing
- **GitHub**: Public archival, NHS integration, and developer feedback

## Practitioner Role

Practitioners are stewards of override ethics. They annotate simulations, validate badge flow, and ensure civic resonance in every activation.

## Ethical Notes

Override is never automatic. It is badge-qualified, logged, and sealed. Privacy is suspended only when mood, seal, and echo conditions are met. All events are timestamped and reviewed.

**Legacy encoded. Override attuned. NHS aligned.**
