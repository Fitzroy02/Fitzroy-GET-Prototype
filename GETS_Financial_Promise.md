## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **GETS is a civic standard, not a commercial product.**  
2. **All funds are deployed to maintain the integrity, security, and open availability of the GETS Civic Communication Protocol (CCP v1.0).**  
3. **No resources are used for personal wealth creation.**  
4. **All financial partners are invited as Legacy Stewards, not investors.**  
5. **Funding ensures zero-cost access for teachers, therapists, and civic workers in strained care systems.**  
6. **This promise governs all technical development, badge registry upkeep, audit schema hosting, and practitioner onboarding.**
