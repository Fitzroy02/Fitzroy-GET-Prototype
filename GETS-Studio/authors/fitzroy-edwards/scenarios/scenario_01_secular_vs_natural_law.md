## Summary
A team of subcontracted carpenters installs a roof according to the original plans, only to discover that the drawings were amended without their knowledge. The error is systemic, yet the burden falls on the most vulnerable.

Under secular law, their rights are minimal, including weekly wages, no recourse, and easy termination. The employer escapes liability through legal loopholes, while the workers face financial and emotional fallout.

This scenario invites reflection on the tension between Magna Carta (institutional law) and Natural Law (moral fairness). It asks: Is justice a matter of procedure or intuition?

The protagonist, a time-served carpenter, navigates a world of short-term contracts, re-employment without loyalty, and communication breakdowns. The puzzle is not who is correct, but how can a person contribute to an ethical system designed to obscure the moral right?

Is the safest bet to stay at home, continue to use your trade and contribute to society, or find a new direction?
