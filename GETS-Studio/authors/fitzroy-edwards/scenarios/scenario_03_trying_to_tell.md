## Scenario Text
After a brief stay in a mental health hospital, the protagonist returns home to Newington Green—a familiar yet fragmented landscape. A benefit cheque brings momentary relief. He shops locally, observing the slow erosion of small businesses under Tesco’s shadow. The community is warm but distant: faces known, names forgotten.

Beste Aydin, a long-time acquaintance and second-hand shop owner, greets him with concern. She asks to stay in his spare room with her boyfriend Mehmet. The request is casual, yet layered. He agrees, partly for companionship, partly out of civic generosity.

Later, he reflects on the encounter while writing:

“Please stop fighting.”

The blog post that follows is an attempt to be heard—not just by Beste, but by the world. It’s unclear whether the writing is a cry for help, a gesture of peace, or a philosophical transmission. The scenario ends not with resolution, but with a quiet tap of the keys.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Is proximity a form of care or intrusion?
- Can concern mask self-interest?
- What does it mean to be “heard” in a world of transactional relationships?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- Civic perception and relational ethics
- The role of proximity in care and control
- Emotional transmission in urban solitude
- The ethics of asking for help vs. offering it
