## Scenario Text
The protagonist wakes to a world saturated in death, corruption, and despair. The news is unbearable, and his mind is fraying. Friends express concern; social media connections dissolve. He considers seeking medical help—not out of panic, but as a civic gesture of self-check.

He visits the Edinburgh Cellars, a local pub where he’s known as a carpenter, deejay, and promoter. The landlords, Simon and Neil, are complex figures—one gentle, one arrogant, both racially ambiguous in their dealings. A chance encounter with Tom Moore, a blunt Mancunian friend, leads to a detour: a drink, then a drive to Euston General Hospital.

During the ride, something shifts. A warm, swelling sensation overtakes his mind—pleasurable, overwhelming, revelatory. He declares, “Tom, I know everything.” The moment is euphoric, yet disorienting. He tries to explain his thoughts on humanity’s survival, creationism, and past trauma to the doctors. They don’t understand. He’s dismissed as “fine” and sent home.

The scenario ends with a quiet thank-you to Tom and a blog post written in the wake of revelation.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Can a mental condition be considered a symptom, a form of enlightenment, or an awakening of the mind?
- Since most citizens are not doctors, why is their perception correct when deception is unwritten history?
- What happens when society medicalises revelation?
- Is the doctor’s dismissal a failure of care or a boundary of reason?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
