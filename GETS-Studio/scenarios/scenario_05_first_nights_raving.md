## Scenario Text
The protagonist recalls a formative wound: a music teacher slamming the piano lid on his six-year-old hands. The act of violence, racialisation, and silencing marks the beginning of musical reluctance. Years later, music returns through community: steel bands, youth clubs, and the pulsing heart of Manchester’s nightlife.

A steel band gig ends in betrayal. Mr Brown, a teacher and organiser, pockets performance fees under the guise of “school funds.” The band dissolves, unpaid and disillusioned. Yet music persists. Students dub-step through corridors, teachers rage like piranhas, and youth clubs become sanctuaries of sound.

At sixteen, the protagonist enters Legends nightclub. Glitter balls spin, bass throbs, and jazz fusion electrifies the crowd. DJs like Greg Wilson and Chad Jackson soundtrack a new kind of awakening. Music becomes not just entertainment, but a form of resistance—a way to reclaim joy, space, and identity.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Can music heal wounds inflicted by authority?
- Is unpaid labour ever justified by communal joy?
- What does it mean to dance in defiance of betrayal?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- The ethics of musical labour and unpaid performance
- Rhythm as resistance to systemic betrayal
- Club culture as civic pulse and communal identity
