## Scenario Text
After days in Opal Ward, the protagonist is discharged on 7th June 2009. He publishes a blog written during his hospital stay—a symbolic manifesto. He reflects on the meaning of names:
- Fitzroy: bastard + royal
- Brian: a transposition of letters
- Edwards: an economic slave name
- DJ Fitz E / Man Egg: a dual-brained son, fractured yet whole

He recounts physical trauma—broken leg, broken jaw—and a biblical echo:

“I offered the other cheek, and it was taken.”

The blog ends with a declaration:

“I have decreed absolute.”

This is not madness—it is metaphysical clarity. A symbolic act. A civic transmission.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Can symbolic naming reclaim agency from systemic erasure?
- Is a decree a form of healing or hubris?
- What does it mean to assert “absolute” after institutional containment?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- The ethics of naming and reclaiming identity
- Trauma, fate, and metaphysical assertion
- Symbolic decree as civic and personal transformation
