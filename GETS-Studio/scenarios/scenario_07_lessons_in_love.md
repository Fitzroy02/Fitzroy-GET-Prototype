## Scenario Text
The protagonist meets Alice Barnaby during his college years—his first true love, a practising Christian drawn into the club scene. Their relationship grows amid music, parties, and youthful exploration. After eighteen months together, his devotion is clear:

“My heart and mind were on Alice.”

At a reggae blues party in Hulme, Alice invites him to explore a neighbouring flat. Inside, they encounter Dan Redbridge—a short-tempered acquaintance who boldly invites Alice to sit on his lap. The protagonist, confident in their bond, gently says, “Come over here.” Alice replies coldly:

“No.”

The moment is shattering. She chooses Dan’s invitation over her boyfriend’s presence. The protagonist leaves the party, humiliated and confused. He never asks what happened. The silence becomes its own answer.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Why didn’t Alice support her boyfriend in that moment?
- Was her response a test, a rejection, or a revelation?
- Can love survive humiliation without explanation?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

## Relational Triad
- The Protagonist: vulnerable, devoted, humiliated
- Alice Barnaby: enigmatic, provocative, emotionally distant
- Dan Redbridge: bold, disrespectful, catalyst of rupture

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
