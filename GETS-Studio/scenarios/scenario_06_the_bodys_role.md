## Scenario Text
The protagonist traces maternal lineage to Hyacinth Shirley Minott, cousin of reggae legend Sugar Minott. The name Hyacinth evokes myth: a Greek youth struck by Zeus’s discus. The body, from the start, is a site of impact.

His mother survives a toxic fire at Woolworths, where flammable foam kills several shoppers. New safety laws follow—but only after tragedy. Rita Taylor’s child dies in a washing machine accident; her body is burned beyond repair. Again, regulation trails behind loss.

The scenario expands: cars without seatbelts, the internet without safeguards, and children preyed upon through screens. The body becomes a ledger of systemic failure. The protagonist asks:

“Intelligence thinks, is society thinking?”

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Is public safety a moral duty or a reactive concession?
- How many bodies must suffer before systems change?
- Can society claim intelligence if it ignores embodied harm?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- The ethics of delayed public safety
- Bodily harm as civic ledger
- Systemic neglect and reactive governance
