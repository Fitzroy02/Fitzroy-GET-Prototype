## Scenario Text
The protagonist reflects on his early social media presence—no photo, just music, mystery, and curated party groups. His page is suspended amid copyright disputes, and he begins to question whether his digital footprint is entangled in broader political scandals. Emails to the Prime Minister and President coincide with the Labour Party email leak and the rise of Pirate Bay.

Swine Flu looms. He senses that “the powers that be” are preparing for something—perhaps him. Yet no contact comes. He waits, writes, prays. The writing becomes a ritual, a civic offering, a poetic plea:

“If only someone could hear what I’m saying, we could achieve peace with a bright new rainbow.”

The scenario ends with a pivot—an invitation to flip the clock back to his first party night out, suggesting that memory and mystery are entwined.

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Can digital platforms shape or distort mental clarity?
- Is civic suspicion a symptom or a sign of help?
- What is the ethical weight of a poetic statement in a world of algorithms?

There are no right answers, only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- The ethics of digital identity and civic suspicion
- Poetic transmission as a form of resistance
- The blurred line between delusion and insight
