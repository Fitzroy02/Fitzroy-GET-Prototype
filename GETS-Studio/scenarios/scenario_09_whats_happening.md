## Scenario Text
The protagonist wakes to a quiet spring morning, writes a blog, then descends into a psychotic episode—screaming, kicking, growling, and banging on the table. His body moves without volition. He calls out for Beste, who lives with her boyfriend Mehmet. They respond with confusion and concern.

Mehmet, bewildered, tries to help. Beste offers her hand, her voice gentle. The protagonist cannot trust the gesture. He follows them to the shop below, where his behaviour continues—rocking, crouching, sniffing a cigarette, unable to explain what’s happening. A call from Edwin Blair adds urgency. Beste asks, “Should I phone for an ambulance?” He says yes.

In the storeroom, Beste holds his hand and asks, “Are you okay?” Her concern is real. But in that moment, a new fear arises:

“A sense of fear for authority came over me, something I’d never felt before.”

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Is the protagonist’s body revealing a truth his mind cannot grasp?
- Can relational care hold space for breakdown without institutional escalation?
- What does it mean to fear authority when seeking help?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

## Relational Triad
- The Protagonist: unraveling, perceptive, vulnerable
- Beste Aydin: gentle, attentive, bridging care and action
- Mehmet Cetin: confused, cautious, protective observer

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
