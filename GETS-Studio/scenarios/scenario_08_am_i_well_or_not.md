## Scenario Text
The protagonist wakes late, taps out blog posts in response to the news, and walks through the quiet streets of Newington Green. He meets Terry Yoruba—a lively, thoughtful man—and shares reflections on creationism and humanity’s plight. They agree on much, parting with mutual respect.

Later, he cycles to Westminster, seeking someone of importance. No one listens. At Sarah’s flat, over food and joints, he breaks down in tears—unexpected, unprovoked, deeply felt. He writes a blog and delivers it to Stoke Newington police station. The duty officer, confused, asks:

“What am I to do with this?”

He replies:

“I’m just following my mind.”

The blog reads:

“I decree incompetence in secular, Islamic, and communist laws. I have defined logic, so I decree absolute and I rule the world; it is game over.”

## Ethical Dilemma
The reader is invited to consider:
- Is the protagonist well—or simply unheard?
- Can emotional collapse be a form of civic transmission?
- What is the role of institutions when minds speak outside their frameworks?

There are no right answers—only civic reflection.

### 🎓 Curriculum Hook
This scenario can be used in GETS Studio modules exploring:
- The ethics of mental clarity and civic transmission
- Institutional response to non-normative expression
