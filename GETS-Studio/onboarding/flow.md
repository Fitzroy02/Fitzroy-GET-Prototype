# 🚪 GETS Studio Onboarding Flow

Welcome to GETS Studio. This onboarding flow is designed to help new contributors—writers, developers, and visual artists—engage with the archive, understand badge logic, and begin civic rehearsal.

## 🧱 Step 1: Read the Manifest
Start with `john_t_hope_manifest.yaml` to understand the scenarios, badges, and curriculum hooks.

## 🎨 Step 2: Media Tools (No Badge Required)
Visual artists may upload:
- Scenario illustrations
- Badge iconography
- Civic posters and covers
- Symbolic personae portraits

No badge gating applies. Upload is the only requirement.

## 🛡️ Step 3: Scenario Rehearsal (Badge Required)
To contribute to scenario modules, review the badge logic and gating protocol in the manifest.

## 🔌 Step 4: Port Setup
Review `network.yaml` to ensure your environment supports the required ports.

## 🌀 Step 5: Begin with a Welcome Scenario
Start with [Welcome Scenario](welcome_scenario.md) to rehearse your first civic transmission.
