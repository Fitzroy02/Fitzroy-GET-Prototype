    This module ensures your DJ stream resonates clearly. Use it to diagnose playback issues and uphold sonic integrity.

    **1. Is the file format supported?**  
    Streamlit supports MP3, WAV, and OGG formats. Other formats may not play.

    **2. Is the file too large or slow to load?**  
    Large files can cause delays or failures. Try a smaller audio clip to rule out bandwidth or loading issues.

    **3. Is your browser blocking autoplay or sound?**  
    Many browsers mute autoplay by default. Try pressing play manually or adjust your browserâ€™s sound settings.

    **4. Is the audio hosted locally or remotely?**  
    - If local: Double-check the file path (it must be accessible to the Streamlit server).  
    - If remote: Test the URL directly in your browser to ensure it works and is reachable.
