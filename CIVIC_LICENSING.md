# 🌬️ Civic Licensing Framework for The Whistling Wind

Welcome, steward. This repository hosts works of poetic, civic, and ethical transmission. Each upload is a gesture—not just a file.

## 🛡️ License Types

Each work must declare one of the following license types:

- **Open Civic Read**: Free to preview, not downloadable.
- **Scenario Access**: Accessed only through scenario prompts (e.g., Ethical Pause).
- **Stewarded Access**: Previewable, with payment required for extended access.
- **Downloadable License**: Full access and download permitted.
- **Consignment License**: For bookshop placement only, not for public access.

## 📤 Upload Guidelines

Each submission must include:

- Title and Author
- License Type
- Price (if applicable)
- Scenario Tags (e.g., Legacy Stewardship, Invocation)
- Download Permission
- Preview Length

## 🌀 Ethical Principles

- No download without explicit permission.
- Scenario framing is civic, not commercial.
- Payment unlocks access, not ownership.
- Each upload is a transmission, not a transaction.

## 🧠 Contact

*"Let each breath be carried with care, each word stewarded with grace."*
