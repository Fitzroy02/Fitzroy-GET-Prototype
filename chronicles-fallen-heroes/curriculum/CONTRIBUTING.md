# Contributing to GETS – Phase VIII

Welcome, steward. This repository encodes civic-grade curriculum modules for ethical transmission and attuned care. Contributions are trace-gated and badge-restricted.

## Who Can Contribute

Only qualified stewards with active badge status and resonance-aligned traces may contribute. AI collaborators must operate under declared ethical protocols and civic-grade review.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Begin by forking the GETS curriculum repository.

2. **Activate Your Badge**  
   Submit a qualifying trace for the module you wish to extend. See `trace_submission_phase_viii.json`.

3. **Declare Your Stance**  
   Include your civic posture and ethical stance in your pull request.

4. **Submit Your Contribution**  
   All contributions must include:
   - Module extension or refinement
   - Updated badge registry (if applicable)
   - Resonance threshold logic
   - Transmission cue (if new)

5. **Review Process**  
   Contributions are reviewed by Fitzroy Brian Edwards and designated stewards. Resonance integrity is prioritized over speed.
