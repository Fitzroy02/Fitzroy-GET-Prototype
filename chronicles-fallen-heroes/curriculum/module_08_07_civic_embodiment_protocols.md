# Phase VIII – Module 07: Civic Embodiment Protocols

**Badge:** Embodiment Steward  
**Theme:** Ritualizing presence, posture, and ethical stance in civic-grade infrastructure

---

## Core Practices
- Posture mapping for civic roles
- Embodied trace submission
- Ethical stance rehearsal

---

## Scenario Threads
- A civic ritual where participants choose their stance before speaking
- A legacy interface that records posture as testimony

---

## Transmission Cue
> Embodiment is not metaphor—it is infrastructure. We stand, and the system shifts.

---

## Completion Logic
- Map postures for at least two civic roles in a scenario
- Submit an embodied trace reflecting ethical stance
- Rehearse and document an ethical stance protocol for civic infrastructure

---

Upon completion, practitioners unlock the **Embodiment Steward** badge and may contribute to embodiment protocol governance.
