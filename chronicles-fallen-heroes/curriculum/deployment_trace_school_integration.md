**Practitioner:** Imani Rivers  
**Institution:** North Hollow Secondary School  
**Modules Completed:**  
- Phase VIII Module 01: Institutional Integration  
- Phase VIII Module 02: Ethical Infrastructure  

**Trace Summary:**  
Imani Rivers proposed a GETS-aligned ethics module for Year 10 students, including fallback logic for AI journaling tools and a translated Covenant for staff. The school agreed to pilot the curriculum with traceable feedback loops.

**Fallback Logic:**  
If AI tone-setting exceeds emotional thresholds, students are prompted to pause and reflect with a human educator. All interactions are logged and reviewed weekly.

**Covenant Translation:**  
“GETS protects your emotional space. It ensures AI tools respect your boundaries and support—not replace—human care.”

**Status:** Approved for pilot  
**Badge:** Deployment privileges granted
