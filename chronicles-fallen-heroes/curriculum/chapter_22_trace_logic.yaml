title: Weaving Humour Into Depth
theme: Remixing wit and sorrow for civic resonance
logic:
  trace_conditions:
    - humour_depth_ratio >= 0.7
    - sorrow_echo_detected == true
    - timing_refinement == validated
  badge_conditions:
    - emotional_tuning == attuned
    - civic_applicability == confirmed
    - remix_style in ["parable", "one-liner", "diary stream"]
examples:
  grounded_wisdom:
    - "Even a cracked pot carries water."
    - "Joy’s not loud, it’s the quiet bit that stays after the music fades."
    - "Sadness is a good listener. Joy is a good dancer. Sometimes you need both at the party."
  timing_refinement:
    - "Even umbrellas get tired of pretending they’re strong."
    - "Some puddles aren’t meant to be jumped, they’re meant to be stared into."
notes:
  - Humour is not escape—it is echo.
  - Timing is civic: silence, pause, and undertone are part of the trace.
  - Remix logic must balance levity with legacy.
