# Civic Triage Ethics – Practitioner Review Script

## Reviewer Role: ethical_scheduler / pediatric_ethics_guardian / diary_scheduler

---

### 1. Badge Status Verification
- Confirm all required module badges are marked as complete or pending review.
- Note any modules where badge status is still pending or incomplete.

### 2. Scenario Rehearsal Log
- Review the practitioner’s rehearsal log for each scenario:
  - Has the practitioner completed all required scenarios?
  - Are there pending or skipped scenarios?
- Request reflection or remediation for any incomplete rehearsals.

### 3. Emotional Tool Engagement
- Check which emotional tools have been engaged (e.g., urgency_resonator, triage_reflector).
- Ask the practitioner to describe how each tool influenced their decision-making.

### 4. Civic Prompt & Reflection
- Review submitted civic prompt responses for depth, clarity, and ethical resonance.
- Ask the practitioner to elaborate on any ambiguous or surface-level responses.

### 5. Resonance Threshold & Integrity
- Assess whether the practitioner’s actions and reflections meet the resonance threshold for the module (e.g., civic_triage_ethics, child_agency_protected, rhythm_respected).
- If resonance is not achieved, provide feedback and request further rehearsal or reflection.

### 6. Final Review & Badge Award
- If all criteria are met, mark the review as complete and award the relevant badge (e.g., triage_ethics_certified).
- If not, outline next steps for the practitioner.
