Phase VIII: Ethical Triage and Diary-Based Care
Phase VIII is a civic curriculum designed to transform how care is prioritized. It trains practitioners to recognize urgency not just by symptoms, but by encrypted diary traces, emotional resonance, and lived history.
Through scenario rehearsal and emotional tools, practitioners earn badges in:
•  Civic Triage Ethics
•  Pediatric Ethics
•  Mental Health Triage
•  Diary-Based Scheduling
Every module is gated by ethical review and resonance thresholds. This isn’t just training—it’s stewardship.
