  title: Phase VIII Civic Commitment
  audience: public
  statement: >
    I pledge to uphold ethical triage in all forms of care. I recognize that urgency may be invisible, that rhythm must be respected, and that diary traces hold sacred history. I commit to rehearsing care, protecting agency, and engaging emotional tools with integrity. This is not just scheduling—it is stewardship.
