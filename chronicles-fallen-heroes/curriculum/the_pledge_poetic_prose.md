It was a pledge that put her on the edge.  
She was depressed about a promise that was not blessed at best,  
and his dishonesty caused her to jump off a ledge.  

When Perfect Prince first met Ruth the Truth,  
they joyfully played in the snow with a sledge  
near a ledge at the edge of a precipice.  
They decided that before going to bed,  
they would pledge their emotions, be devoted and take the plunge.  

Promising devotion turned into a vow until death do we part.  
They pledged themselves and tied the knot.  
Is there a plot? I think not.  

Now they’re wed. They went to bed  
and pledged their love from the edge of the bed.  
However, Ruth the Truth was unaware and misled after going to bed.  
She didn’t know the Perfect Prince had a double bed  
and another burden on his head.  

This put her on the edge of a tight wedge in her head  
since the promise is not a pledge.  
She was found on the edge of a ledge,  
where Ruth the Truth plunged to her death.  

Promising a pledge of devotion  
can lead some to the edge of a tight wedge on a ledge.  
Don’t pledge or wed on an unseen future;  
you could be used, abused, battered and bruised,  
then end up dead in your bed asking,  
**‘Where’s my head?’**
