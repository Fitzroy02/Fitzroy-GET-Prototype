## Examples

### Grounded Wisdom
- "Even a cracked pot carries water."
- "Joy’s not loud, it’s the quiet bit that stays after the music fades."
- "Sadness is a good listener. Joy is a good dancer. Sometimes you need both at the party."

### Timing Refinement
- "Even umbrellas get tired of pretending they’re strong."
- "Some puddles aren’t meant to be jumped, they’re meant to be stared into."

## Notes
- Humour is not escape—it is echo.
- Timing is civic: silence, pause, and undertone are part of the trace.
- Remix logic must balance levity with legacy.
