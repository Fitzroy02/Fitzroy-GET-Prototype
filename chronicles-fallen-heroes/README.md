# 🛡️ GETS: Governance for Ethical Transmission & Stewardship

**GETS** is a civic-grade protocol for attuned care, ethical AI interaction, and legacy stewardship. It is governed by a non-profit entity committed to integrity, open availability, and ethical continuity.

### 🧭 Core Principles
- No funds are used for personal wealth creation  
- All compensation is structured as essential personnel cost  
- Outreach is framed as Civic Communication for public good  

### 💠 Stewardship & Outreach Budget
GETS is sustained by a transparent, covenant-based budget that includes:
1. **Protocol Maintenance & Security**  
2. **CEO/Executive Director Salary** (Essential Labor)  
3. **Civic Communication & Outreach** (Marketing to teachers, therapists, and civic workers)

### 🔄 Dual-Income Integrity
- **Book Sales** remain a personal income stream, with 50% committed to charity  
- **GETS Funds** are used solely for civic mission and operational continuity  

### 🏛️ Governance
All allocations—including CEO salary—are pre-approved by the **Board of Stewards** and encoded in the **GETS Financial Covenant**.
