# 🏛️ GETS Governance Framework

This document outlines the civic governance structure for the GETS Protocol, ensuring ethical continuity, operational integrity, and transparent stewardship.

## ✳️ Governing Entity
GETS is governed by a non-profit organization committed to the principles of attuned care, ethical AI interaction, and legacy stewardship.

## 👥 Board of Stewards
The Board of Stewards is the primary decision-making body responsible for:
- Approving the annual **Stewardship and Outreach Budget**
- Ratifying the **Financial Promise** (see `promise.md`)
- Appointing and reviewing the CEO/Executive Director
- Ensuring compliance with the **GETS Covenant**

## 🧭 Decision Protocols
All decisions must be:
- **Badge-gated**: Only verified Stewards may vote
- **Transparent**: All votes and budget approvals are logged
- **Covenant-aligned**: No decision may violate the core principle: *No funds are used for personal wealth creation*

## 🧑‍💼 CEO/Executive Director Role
The CEO is responsible for:
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the GETS Protocol
- Overseeing operational continuity
- Representing GETS in civic and ethical forums

Compensation is outlined in the `promise.md` file and must be approved annually.

## 🔐 Steward Verification
Stewards must hold a valid **Governance Badge**, issued via the GETS Badge Registry. Badge logic is defined in `badge.yaml`.
